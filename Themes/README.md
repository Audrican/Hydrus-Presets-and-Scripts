QSS are Qt Style Sheets used to alter colours, fonts, and font sizes in Hydrus. For more information on editing or making your own have a look at [the reference sheet](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-reference.html).

Icons are alternate icons for Hydrus, perhaps for fitting certain desktop themes.
