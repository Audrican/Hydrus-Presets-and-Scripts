Unlike the web frontend of Sankaku the API is not limited and can thus download a lot more in the same timeframe.

To ensure things work properly you will need to delete all bandwidth limits for Sankaku. Depending on the size of your potential query you might need to either delete the limits for global too, or crank them up a fair deal.

The reason for this is that the URLs generated are only valid for a limited time so if you haven't downloaded them when they expire you'll only get trash.
