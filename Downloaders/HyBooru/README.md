# HyBooru

[HyBooru](https://github.com/funmaker/hybooru) is a Hydrus-based booru-styled imageboard in React.

The preset in this folder includes the parsers for any HyBooru instance as well as url classes for [booru.funmaker.moe](https://booru.funmaker.moe/). You can duplicate the post and gallery url classes and change the domain to another HyBooru instance. You will also need to associate those url classes with the parsers and optionally duplicate and edit the GUG for the new instance.
