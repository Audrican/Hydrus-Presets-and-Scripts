[See the help files for how to add downloaders to Hydrus](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/help/adding_new_downloaders.html)

Currently supported downloaders that are not part of Hydrus defaults.

If you're having issues with default downloaders try deleting them and then restoring defaults since they are not always updated properly.

See [unsupported sites](/Unsupported%20sites.md) for sites that are not supported due to technical issues.
