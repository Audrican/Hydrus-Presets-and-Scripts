[See the help files for how to add downloaders to Hydrus](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/help/adding_new_downloaders.html)

The downloader gets original size images so a few galleries are downlodable without being logged in due to being small enough to not be resized. For most galleries though you need to be logged in so import the cookies to Hydrus.

Since Hydrus downloads original images the e-hentai image limit is something you need to keep track of yourself. You can find what it currently is under the overview tab in e-hentai's [My Home](https://e-hentai.org/home.php).

Additionally, the limit isn't 1 image/request = 1 point, it's a bit more complicated than that, details found on e-hentai's [wiki](https://ehwiki.org/wiki/My_Home#Overview), but in general it'll be a minimum of 5 points per image.

Again, it's your own responsibility to not go over this limit and being banned, usually just temporarily.
